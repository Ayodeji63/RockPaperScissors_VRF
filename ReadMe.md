# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game and CharacterNFT

## About

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPC) Game and CharacterNFT projects! This repository hosts a decentralized version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, enhanced with Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for unpredictability and fairness. Additionally, the CharacterNFT system introduces a unique concept of gaming characters represented as NFTs, each evolving based on players' achievements in the RPC game.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

### Quickstart

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayodeji63/RockPaperScissors_VRF.git
forge build
```

### Updates

Stay updated with the latest changes:

- For openzeppelin-contracts, install version 4.8.3 using:

```bash
forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.8.3 --no-commit
```

### Usage

#### Start a Local Node

```bash
make anvil
```

#### Deploy to Polygon (customize for other networks)

```bash
make deployRPC ARGS="--network polygon"
```

### Testing

Explore the four test tiers:

1. Unit
2. Integration
3. Forked
4. Staging

Run the tests:

```bash
forge test
```

#### Test Coverage

```bash
forge coverage
```

### Deployment to Testnet or Mainnet

1. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
OWNER_ADDRESS=
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
PRIVATE_KEY_2=
POLYGON_RPC_URL=
POLYGON_API_KEY=
```

2. Get testnet ETH from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/).

3. Deploy to Polygon:

```bash
make deploy ARGS="--network polygon"
```

#### Mint Characters and Join the Game

Use the provided commands in the make file:

- Mint Character for Player 1:

```bash
make mintCharacter1Pol
```

- Mint Character for Player 2:

```bash
make mintCharacter2Pol
```
- Note: Before running joinGamePol, ensure you've updated the RPC address in the make file, you see this while deploying the RPC or check the `broadcast` folder. This ensures that users are joining the game with the most recent RPC contract address.

- Player 1 Joins the Game:

```bash
make joinGamePol
```

- Player 2 Joins the Game:

```bash
make joinGamePol2
```

### Estimate Gas

Estimate gas costs:

```bash
forge snapshot
```

### Formatting

Run code formatting:

```bash
forge fmt
```

### Slither

Check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
slither :; slither . --config-file slither.config.json
```
